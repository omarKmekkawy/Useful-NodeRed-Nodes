# Useful-NodeRed-Nodes
Useful NodeRed Nodes for RaspberryPi

## Getting Started
I have collected all useful nodes for NodeRed. You can install them using a single command.

## Installing Procedures

first we will need to get into the NodeRed installation folder, execute this command in the terminal.
```
cd ~/.node-red
```
After getting into the NodeRed installation folder, we can now install any nodes we want, just copy this command and execute it in the terminal

```
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm moment node-red-contrib-config node-red-contrib-grove node-red-contrib-diode node-red-contrib-bigtimer node-red-contrib-esplogin node-red-contrib-timeout node-red-node-openweathermap node-red-node-google node-red-node-emoncms node-red-node-geofence node-red-contrib-moment node-red-contrib-particle node-red-contrib-web-worldmap node-red-contrib-ramp-thermostat node-red-contrib-graphs node-red-contrib-isonline node-red-node-ping node-red-node-random node-red-node-smooth node-red-node-arduino node-red-contrib-file-function node-red-contrib-boolean-logic node-red-contrib-blynk-ws node-red-contrib-chatbot node-red-dashboard node-red-node-darksky node-red-contrib-owntracks node-red-contrib-alexa-local node-red-contrib-heater-controller node-red-node-sqlite node-red-contrib-sqldbs node-red-node-mysql node-red-contrib-camerapi node-red-contrib-mjpgcamera node-red-contrib-python-function node-red-contrib-python3-function node-red-contrib-pythonshell node-red-contrib-ip node-red-node-dropbox node-red-node-watson
